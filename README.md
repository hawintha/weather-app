# Weather App
> This project was developed as my solution for The Odin Project's [Weather App Assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-weather-app)

A web-based application built using JavaScript that allows users to check the current and upcoming weather in any city around the world. This weather app fetches the latest weather information from open source APIs and displays the data in a organized format on the browser.
